                    Meet Ali - the oldest and wisest of the Affholder dog clan. She currently resides in Austin, TX where she makes her living chasing any kind of ball, swimming in various dog friendly locations and keeping my oldest in check. Austin marked her fourth city she has lived in along with Boston, St. Louis and New York City. She loves playing ball and hates trash trucks. Ever since moving to Austin, she has really taken to the more relaxed lifestyle compared to NYC and does not plan on leaving anytime soon.

                        Meet Winston - the best looking, smartest, friendliest, coolest, and most physically fit of the Affholder dog clan (and my dog). He currently resides in Lafayetter Square, previously living in Stamford, CT and New York City. Similar to Ali, Winston is absolutely obsessed with ball time, specically tennis ball time as he won't play with any other ball! He is part Boxer and part Rhodesian Ridgeback and comes from the great state of West Virginia.

                        Meet Walter - the youngest of the Affholder dog clan. He also resides in Lafayette Square and is the most sheltered of the Affholder dogs as this is the only place he has ever lived. Even though Walter's life experience isn't wide, anyone that meets him loves him - he was clearly blessed with the social gene. No matter the situation, he wants to be pet and will get what he wants eventually.
